							<span class="number">04</span>
							<h3>Self-Love</h3>
							<p>Now that we know who we truly are, we must learn to love our whole imperfect self. Self-love is so much more than a bubble bath or me-time. Self-love is like a muscle, you can train it.</p>

						</div>

						<div class="features-grid-item" data-bg="images/features-grid/Passion-thumbnail.jpg">
							<span class="number">08</span>
							<h3>Passion</h3>

						</div>

						<div class="features-grid-item" data-bg="images/features-grid/Stillness-thumbnail.jpg">
							<span class="number">09</span>
							<h3>Stillness</h3>

						</div>

						<div class="features-grid-item" data-bg="images/features-grid/Stillness-thumbnail.jpg">
							<span class="number">10</span>

						</div>

						<div class="features-grid-item" data-bg="images/features-grid/Alignment-thumbnail.jpg">
							<span class="number">12</span>
